# Library-Management-System-Using-C
My very First mini-project, did in my first year when I was learning C basics

## Problem Statement: 
Assume that the "Ansprin Library" maintains at most 2700 books. 
##### Data for each book consists of:
* Book Number
* Book Title
* Author
* Publisher
* Year of Publication

##### Checkout data:
* Name
* Address
* Phone
* Book Number
* Checkout Date
* Return Date

##### Write a program to maintain the library including:
* Add new books
* Search the library by book number, author, title, subject, keywords
*  Remove outdated books (all books older than 15 years)
*  Checkout books
*  Return books
