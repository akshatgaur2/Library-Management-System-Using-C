## Library-Management-System-Using-C
Very First mini-project, did in my first year when I was learning C basics

#Problem Statement: 
Assume that the "Ansprin Library" maintains at most 2700 books. 

Data for each book consists of:

  -> Book Number
  
  -> Book Title
  
  -> Author
  
  -> Publisher
  
  -> Year of Publication
  
  -> Subject
  
Checkout data:
  -> Name
  -> Address
  -> Phone
  -> Book Number
  -> Checkout Date
  -> Return Date

Write a program to maintain the library including:
  i) Add new books
  ii) Search the library by book number, author, title, subject, keywords
  iii) Remove outdated books (all books older than 15 years)
  iv) Checkout books
  v) Return books
